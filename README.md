# template-frontend-react-redux-mui
This template project is designed to allow for the quick setup of a React Redux project using the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) framework and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling the code.

## Prerequisites
The following tools are required to set up or run this template:
- [node](https://nodejs.org/) v10.15.3
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.4.1 **or** [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) v1.16.0 

## Setup
1. Clone the repo from https://github.com/FutureCitiesCatapult/template-frontend-react-redux-mui.git.
2. Navigate to the root directory of this new repo and run either of the commands below:
```sh
// with npm
npm run setup

// with yarn
yarn run setup
```
 This `setup` script installs all of the required node packages in the `node_modules` directory then scans for any vulnerabilities within the package files and automatically installs any compatible updates to vulnerable dependencies that were found. 
 
 A blank `.env` file is also created in the root directory (more on environment variables [here](#configuration-using-environment-variables)).
